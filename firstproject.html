                            <strong>Why Assam?</strong><br>
                            All the trustees have some links with North-East. Further, the rural areas of Assam have suffered a lot due to insurgency, flood and other government negligence and therefore, the development has not taken a pace. The flood in this areas which happens every year has one of the main disadvantages and hindrance to the growth. All these things have made the trust to ponder that rural areas of Assam should have better quality of education which should be at par with the urban and the students should feel proud to get the quality education even in rural areas.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Target Population</strong><br>
                            As of now, the area lacks a globally competitive and affordable educational infrastructure especially at pre-primary and senior secondary level. The present government run school are at perils due to absenteeism of teacher, lack of accountability and alien professional management. Further, the target area is in the vicinity of strategic Arunachal Pradesh border where multiple local hurdles impinge education infrastructure from being developed. This forces hundreds of family to send their wards to nearby town/city for education and thus, risking financial and emotional stability. Therefore, Prabha Education Trust which itself is grounded on local roots but global outlook shall provide the targeted population not only comprehensive but also affordable, accessible, accountable educational system. Since the living standards of the targeted population are at medium standards, a quality but affordable education system is a necessity. The moto of the proposed school speaks - LET WISDOM CONQUER ALL. It will seek to ensure that not only education but wisdom is imparted to the students. It will also seek to inculcate NATIONALISM along with FRATERNITY and TOLERANCE at the very beginning of schooling. Further, it will ensure the local culture of the indigenous population is not relegated by fast approaching westernization by incorporating best of local knowledge and arts. It is also bound to take up social perils of the region through various student-led movements.
